## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) - For styles
- [Github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) - For hosting
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) - for CD/CI

### What I learned

During this project I tried using Bootstrap for the first time, and learned how to use bootstrap for styling component. 
Further on, I researched several possible hosting sites, and decided to use Github pages. During this process, I learned how to implement 'gh-pages' library and 'Github Actions' for deployment and CD/CI of my projects.

### Useful resources
